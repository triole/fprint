## Synopsis

Figlet print: a simple shell tool to print text strings with figlet fonts. Basically a wrapper of my fork of [go-figure](https://github.com/common-nighthawk/go-figure).

## Usage

```shell
fprint hello
# or
echo hello | fprint
```

Run `fprint -h` to find out what it can do.

## Config files

Settings can be passed by command line arguments or by config. Configs are in toml format and used with the `-k` parameter. This is how they look.

```toml
text = "main text"
font = "univers"
colour = "yellow"
pretext = "text before"
posttext = "text after"
```

## Build

Either build by hand or use [task](https://github.com/go-task/task).

```shell
# this
go build

# or that
task

# remember what you can do if you have 'task'
task -l
```
